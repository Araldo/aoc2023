# aoc2023

Partly completed solutions for Advent of Code 2023 in Rust (really my first Rust code; I do like the language so far). https://adventofcode.com/2023

Note the style is not representative of what I would write for production code. It is code-competition style where the sole purpose is to find the solution in the minium amount of time.
